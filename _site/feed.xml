&lt;p&gt;Hi! I’m your first Markdown file in &lt;strong&gt;StackEdit&lt;/strong&gt;. If you want to learn about StackEdit, you can read me. If you want to play with Markdown, you can edit me. Once you have finished with me, you can create new files by opening the &lt;strong&gt;file explorer&lt;/strong&gt; on the left corner of the navigation bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;files&quot;&gt;Files&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;StackEdit stores your files in your browser, which means all your files are automatically saved locally and are accessible &lt;strong&gt;offline!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;create-files-and-folders&quot;&gt;Create files and folders&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The file explorer is accessible using the button in left corner of the navigation bar. You can create a new file by clicking the &lt;strong&gt;New file&lt;/strong&gt; button in the file explorer. You can also create folders by clicking the &lt;strong&gt;New folder&lt;/strong&gt; button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;switch-to-another-file&quot;&gt;Switch to another file&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All your files are listed in the file explorer. You can switch from one to another by clicking a file in the list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rename-a-file&quot;&gt;Rename a file&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can rename the current file by clicking the file name in the navigation bar or by clicking the &lt;strong&gt;Rename&lt;/strong&gt; button in the file explorer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;delete-a-file&quot;&gt;Delete a file&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can delete the current file by clicking the &lt;strong&gt;Remove&lt;/strong&gt; button in the file explorer. The file will be moved into the &lt;strong&gt;Trash&lt;/strong&gt; folder and automatically deleted after 7 days of inactivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;export-a-file&quot;&gt;Export a file&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can export the current file by clicking &lt;strong&gt;Export to disk&lt;/strong&gt; in the menu. You can choose to export the file as plain Markdown, as HTML using a Handlebars template or as a PDF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;synchronization&quot;&gt;Synchronization&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Synchronization is one of the biggest features of StackEdit. It enables you to synchronize any file in your workspace with other files stored in your &lt;strong&gt;Google Drive&lt;/strong&gt;, your &lt;strong&gt;Dropbox&lt;/strong&gt; and your &lt;strong&gt;GitHub&lt;/strong&gt; accounts. This allows you to keep writing on other devices, collaborate with people you share the file with, integrate easily into your workflow… The synchronization mechanism takes place every minute in the background, downloading, merging, and uploading file modifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two types of synchronization and they can complement each other:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The workspace synchronization will sync all your files, folders and settings automatically. This will allow you to fetch your workspace on any other device.
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To start syncing your workspace, just sign in with Google in the menu.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The file synchronization will keep one file of the workspace synced with one or multiple files in &lt;strong&gt;Google Drive&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Dropbox&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;GitHub&lt;/strong&gt;.
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Before starting to sync files, you must link an account in the &lt;strong&gt;Synchronize&lt;/strong&gt; sub-menu.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;open-a-file&quot;&gt;Open a file&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can open a file from &lt;strong&gt;Google Drive&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Dropbox&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;GitHub&lt;/strong&gt; by opening the &lt;strong&gt;Synchronize&lt;/strong&gt; sub-menu and clicking &lt;strong&gt;Open from&lt;/strong&gt;. Once opened in the workspace, any modification in the file will be automatically synced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;save-a-file&quot;&gt;Save a file&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can save any file of the workspace to &lt;strong&gt;Google Drive&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Dropbox&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;GitHub&lt;/strong&gt; by opening the &lt;strong&gt;Synchronize&lt;/strong&gt; sub-menu and clicking &lt;strong&gt;Save on&lt;/strong&gt;. Even if a file in the workspace is already synced, you can save it to another location. StackEdit can sync one file with multiple locations and accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;synchronize-a-file&quot;&gt;Synchronize a file&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once your file is linked to a synchronized location, StackEdit will periodically synchronize it by downloading/uploading any modification. A merge will be performed if necessary and conflicts will be resolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you just have modified your file and you want to force syncing, click the &lt;strong&gt;Synchronize now&lt;/strong&gt; button in the navigation bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;strong&gt;Synchronize now&lt;/strong&gt; button is disabled if you have no file to synchronize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;manage-file-synchronization&quot;&gt;Manage file synchronization&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since one file can be synced with multiple locations, you can list and manage synchronized locations by clicking &lt;strong&gt;File synchronization&lt;/strong&gt; in the &lt;strong&gt;Synchronize&lt;/strong&gt; sub-menu. This allows you to list and remove synchronized locations that are linked to your file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;publication&quot;&gt;Publication&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Publishing in StackEdit makes it simple for you to publish online your files. Once you’re happy with a file, you can publish it to different hosting platforms like &lt;strong&gt;Blogger&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Dropbox&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Gist&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;GitHub&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Google Drive&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;WordPress&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Zendesk&lt;/strong&gt;. With &lt;a href=&quot;http://handlebarsjs.com/&quot;&gt;Handlebars templates&lt;/a&gt;, you have full control over what you export.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Before starting to publish, you must link an account in the &lt;strong&gt;Publish&lt;/strong&gt; sub-menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;publish-a-file&quot;&gt;Publish a File&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can publish your file by opening the &lt;strong&gt;Publish&lt;/strong&gt; sub-menu and by clicking &lt;strong&gt;Publish to&lt;/strong&gt;. For some locations, you can choose between the following formats:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Markdown: publish the Markdown text on a website that can interpret it (&lt;strong&gt;GitHub&lt;/strong&gt; for instance),&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;HTML: publish the file converted to HTML via a Handlebars template (on a blog for example).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;update-a-publication&quot;&gt;Update a publication&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After publishing, StackEdit keeps your file linked to that publication which makes it easy for you to re-publish it. Once you have modified your file and you want to update your publication, click on the &lt;strong&gt;Publish now&lt;/strong&gt; button in the navigation bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;strong&gt;Publish now&lt;/strong&gt; button is disabled if your file has not been published yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;manage-file-publication&quot;&gt;Manage file publication&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since one file can be published to multiple locations, you can list and manage publish locations by clicking &lt;strong&gt;File publication&lt;/strong&gt; in the &lt;strong&gt;Publish&lt;/strong&gt; sub-menu. This allows you to list and remove publication locations that are linked to your file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;markdown-extensions&quot;&gt;Markdown extensions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;StackEdit extends the standard Markdown syntax by adding extra &lt;strong&gt;Markdown extensions&lt;/strong&gt;, providing you with some nice features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ProTip:&lt;/strong&gt; You can disable any &lt;strong&gt;Markdown extension&lt;/strong&gt; in the &lt;strong&gt;File properties&lt;/strong&gt; dialog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;smartypants&quot;&gt;SmartyPants&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SmartyPants converts ASCII punctuation characters into “smart” typographic punctuation HTML entities. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;ASCII&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;HTML&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Single backticks&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;'Isn't this fun?'&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;‘Isn’t this fun?’&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Quotes&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;Isn't this fun?&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;“Isn’t this fun?”&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Dashes&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;– is en-dash, — is em-dash&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;uml-diagrams&quot;&gt;UML diagrams&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can render UML diagrams using &lt;a href=&quot;https://mermaidjs.github.io/&quot;&gt;Mermaid&lt;/a&gt;. For example, this will produce a sequence diagram:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-mermaid&quot;&gt;sequenceDiagram
Alice -&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
Bob--&amp;gt;&amp;gt;John: How about you John?
Bob--x Alice: I am good thanks!
Bob-x John: I am good thanks!
Note right of John: Bob thinks a long&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;long time, so long&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;that the text does&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;not fit on a row.

Bob--&amp;gt;Alice: Checking with John...
Alice-&amp;gt;John: Yes... John, how are you?
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this will produce a flow chart:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-mermaid&quot;&gt;graph LR
A[Square Rect] -- Link text --&amp;gt; B((Circle))
A --&amp;gt; C(Round Rect)
B --&amp;gt; D{Rhombus}
C --&amp;gt; D
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ASCII	HTML
Single backticks	‘Isn’t this fun?’	‘Isn’t this fun?’
Quotes	“Isn’t this fun?”	“Isn’t this fun?”
Dashes	– is en-dash, — is em-dash	– is en-dash, — is em-dash
KaTeX
You can render LaTeX mathematical expressions using KaTeX:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gamma function satisfying \Gamma(n) = (n-1)!\quad\forall n\in\mathbb NΓ(n)=(n−1)!∀n∈N is via the Euler integral&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\Gamma(z) = \int_0^\infty t^{z-1}e^{-t}dt\,.
Γ(z)=∫ 
0
∞
​	
 t 
z−1
 e 
−t
 dt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find more information about LaTeX mathematical expressions here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UML diagrams
You can render UML diagrams using Mermaid. For example, this will produce a sequence diagram:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alice
Bob
John
Hello Bob, how are you?
How about you John?
I am good thanks!
I am good thanks!
Bob thinks a long
long time, so long
that the text does
not fit on a row.
Checking with John…
Yes… John, how are you?
Alice
Bob
John
And this will produce a flow chart:&lt;/p&gt;

The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;The Final Frontier&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Reaching for the Stars&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;The Final Frontier&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Reaching for the Stars&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.&lt;/p&gt;
